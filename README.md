## Overview 

We are tasked with figuring out if bike rental is worth investing into. We have to figure out how long the bikes are being rented for and the most popular times to be riding a bike. We also have to update the given file to us to make it easier to access with tableau.

## Results

I was able to figure out a multitude of information. Now we know that there are a higher amount of males renting out bikes then females. also the highest amount of hours rented is for around 5-6 hours.Also, The highest amount of suscribers were born in 1969 which means more middle age people are renting bikes. I have included my link to my Tableau project here so you can view more information

## Conclusion


It looks like there are more males to females that rent out bikes. Thursday seems to be the highest day of rental as well. But this data does not account for the colder months or even things like covid-19 which would see a large decrease in suscribers and customers. We should look for ways to increase female riders. Also it may work out to add more suscribers by adding deals.
